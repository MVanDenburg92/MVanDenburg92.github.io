			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a GIS analyst with a mind for creative innovation and implementation. During the outbreak of COVID-19, I managed a full load of graduate courses while working as a course assistant converting the class to an online format in tandem with the course professor. As I head into the final year of my Masters in GIS at Clark University I'm working for Clark Labs as a Remote Sensing Research Assistant as part of the Half-Earth project with ESRI with the goal of creating a predictive climate change model for each country in the world for the year 2050.</p>
